# Autoinstall
#
# Since version 20.04, the server installer supports automated installation mode (autoinstallation
# for short). You might also know this feature as unattended, hands-off, or preseeded installation.
#
# Autoinstallation lets you answer all those configuration questions ahead of time with an
# autoinstall config, and lets the installation process run without any interaction.
#
# The `user-data` is a regular Cloud Init config

      replace_linux_default: true

      # Certain platforms, like uefi and prep systems utilize NVRAM to hold boot configuration
      # settings which control the order in which devices are booted. Curtin by default will enable
      # NVRAM updates to boot configuration settings. Users may disable NVRAM updates by setting the
      # update_nvram value to False
      update_nvram: true

      # Curtin is typically used with MAAS where the systems are configured to boot from the network
      # leaving MAAS in control. On UEFI systems, after installing a bootloader the systems
      # BootOrder may be updated to boot from the new entry. This breaks MAAS control over the
      # system as all subsequent reboots of the node will no longer boot over the network.
      # Therefore, if reorder_uefi is True curtin will modify the UEFI BootOrder settings to place
      # the currently booted entry (BootCurrent) to the first option after installing the new target
      # OS into the UEFI boot menu. The result is that the system will boot from the same device
      # that it booted to run curtin; for MAAS this will be a network device.
      #
      # On some UEFI systems the BootCurrent entry may not be present. This can cause a system to
      # not boot to the same device that it was previously booting. If BootCurrent is not present,
      # curtin will update the BootOrder such that all Network related entries are placed before
      # the newly installed boot entry and all other entries are placed at the end. This enables
      # the system to network boot first and on failure will boot the most recently installed entry
      #
      # This setting is ignored if update_nvram is False.
